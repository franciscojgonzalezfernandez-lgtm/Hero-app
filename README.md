# Heroes APP

## Description

This is a project in where I'm trying to use all the MORE modern libraries & concepts of Frontend Develpment to keeping me fresh & try some of new libraries that I didn't use before. From the whole design of the application made in lovable, to the use of all the libraries listed below:

### React 19.1

Waiting for react 19.2 with the automatic collector and other features, I'm still using the lastest version of react 19.1.

#### React-Router

#### Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext & Context Provider)

#### Typescript

One of the best discoverings of humanity. React works perfectly with Typescript, doing it more secure and making the development process more friendly.

#### use API

#### Tailwilnd

Creating sinergies with a lot of libraries & built-in components, this is the tool I was craving to try.

#### Tanstack-query

#### Axios

#### ViteJS and Vitest

#### Shadcn

One of my favourites. This library always helped me to build applications so quick with high standards of Accesibility and easy customization.
